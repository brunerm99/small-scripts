# Small Scripts
Houses some of the small scripts I write to make things 0.0001% easier. 
Fortunately, for each of them I only spend a couple hours googling `regex` syntax, `awk` commands, etc.
Many of these scripts will probably be forgotten soon / left unfinished anyway.

## Setup
Files with a comment saying `production: true` will be copied to `$HOME/.local/bin/` using `setup.sh`.
This may be a bad way to do this, but it works.
